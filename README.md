## Hi There,hope you are doing great !

So in this project i have made a webpage design of a music player using HTML and CSS. This was a project i was given after learning CSS and HTML and i made it in 2 days. We were given image of the project that how it should look. So below are the images of the webpage that yo will get after using the code in my repo :)<br>
